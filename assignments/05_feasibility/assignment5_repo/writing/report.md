Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.

Please address the following prompts to demonstrate the feasibility of your research project idea.

1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

TODO

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

TODO

4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

TODO

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

10. Please provide a cohesive blog post for feasibility on your website (min 200 words) to summarize your answers for the above questions.

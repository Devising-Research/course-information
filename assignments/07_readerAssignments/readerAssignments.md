CS580: Preferences for your first and second readers
Deadline: April 26th by 8:30am.

For your senior thesis work, you will have a first and second reader to assist in your work. Although you are invited to select your readers based on their research area(s) and its alignment with your idea area, this may not be the only criteria that you could apply to your voting. You are not necessarily guaranteed to get the readers that you select but your selection will help in the reader assignment decision making process.

YOU SHOULD NOT REGISTER FOR 600 UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE FINAL READER ASSIGNMENTS FROM ME (about a week after the deadline).

Please note that if you are a double major, there will be a new course created for you (DOUBL first_major-second_major). You will have two first readers, one from each department, instead of having a first reader and a second reader. Your senior project will need to satisfy the requirements of both departments and you will follow the general guidelines in terms of timeline and the required deliverables that both departments agree to.

Please note that if you are an Integrative Informatics major you are to select your readers from the Integrative Informatics list. Although the requirements for your project deliverable might differ from computer science due to the applied focus of informatics projects, the general guidelines will be the same.
